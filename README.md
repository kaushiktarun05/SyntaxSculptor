## Introduction

This repository provides C++ implementations for:
1. **Parsers**: Various types of parsers used in syntax analysis.
2. **FIRST and FOLLOW Sets**: Algorithms to compute the FIRST and FOLLOW sets for a given grammar, which are essential for constructing predictive parsers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository to your local machine and follow the installation instructions below.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- C++ Compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- CMake (optional, for building the project)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-parsers-first-follow.git
    cd cpp-parsers-first-follow
    ```

2. (Optional) Build the project using CMake:

    ```sh
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

## Usage

You can compile and run the individual C++ files for specific parsers or FIRST/FOLLOW set computations. Here is an example of how to compile and run a C++ file:

```sh
g++ -o parser parsers/your_parser.cpp
./parser
